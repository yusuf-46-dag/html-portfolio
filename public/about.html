  Hello. My name is Yusuf surname Dağ, I'm a twenty three years old and my father is a job janitor and my mother is a job housewife.

  In 2023, I dropped out of Kayseri University and started preparing for the university entrance exam again. During this period, I worked as a waiter while also attending a prep course to study for the exam. Later on, I became a Computer Programming student at Fırat University in Elazığ.

  Right now, I’m very happy with this situation. It has helped me get to know myself better, and I’ve started to experience the joy of truly becoming a programmer.
